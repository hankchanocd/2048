# Make 2048
My version of Gabriele Cirulli's [original 2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/). 

The original version is a small clone of [1024](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024), based on [Saming's 2048](http://saming.fr/p/2048/) (also a clone).

### Notes for the Udacity version
This version is forked and modified from the Udacity version. You can [fork the original repo as well](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048)

## License
2048 is licensed under the [MIT license.](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)

## Donations
Gabriele made this in his spare time, and it's hosted on GitHub (which means there's no hosting costs), but if you enjoyed the game and feel like buying him coffee, you can donate at his BTC address: `1Ec6onfsQmoP9kkL3zkpB6c5sA4PVcXU2i`.
